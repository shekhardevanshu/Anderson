# Entanglement Dynamics in 3D Anderson Model

We analyze the single-particle entanglement entropy of the 3D Anderson Model with periodic boundary conditions. The Hamiltonian is diagonalized in `C` using the `SLEPc` library, and the eigenvectors and eigenvalues are calculated. The entanglement analysis is later done in the `Julia` programming language. The aim is to give a single-parameter formulation of the entanglement dynamics [[1]](#1).
